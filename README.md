# Fire and Flood Insurance and Investment Firm Strategies

#### Preston, Ghazi, Ann, Dean, Arnold

## Project Description/Outline

We will analyze the historical data of floods and fires related to claims paid and premiums charged by the insurance company. We will look at how many times a year floods and fires occur in the US (frequency). We will look at total amounts paid out in claims and the average amount paid per claim (severity). This will allow us to predict a pricing structure per insurance line (premiums) to be profitable and have funds to invest. What should we inveset in to maximize returns? 

## Research Questions to Answer

What does a map of all national disasters look like?

What is the serverity and frequency of flood and fire damages in the US? How much and how often do we have to payout for fires and flood?

Average cost per claim? On average what premium should we charge to be a profitable insurance company?

What is the loss ratio of fires and floods? Do we have enough premiums to cover claims? If yes, how much can we invest ?

What is the risk of flood and fire in each state?

Given the surplus from an 80% loss ratio (i.e. 20% investment of premiums), what returns should we expect from our selected stocks or portfolio of stocks if invested with 20% initial investment.

# Discussion/Analysis

* Data Analysis

  * Discuss the steps you took to analyze the data and answer each question you asked in your proposal.
  * Present and discuss interesting figures developed during analysis, ideally with the help of Jupyter Notebook.

* Discussion
    * Discuss your findings. Did you find what you expected to find? If not, why not? What inferences or general conclusions can you draw from your analysis?

* Postmortem

  * Discuss any difficulties that arose, and how you dealt with them.
  * Discuss any additional questions that came up, but which you didn't have time to answer: What would you research next, if you had two more weeks?

* Questions
  * Open-floor Q&A with the audience
