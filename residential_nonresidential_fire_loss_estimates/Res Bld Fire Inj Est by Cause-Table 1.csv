Residential Building Causes -  ROUNDED National Fire Injury Estimates by Cause (2003-2018),,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,* Sum of causes may not equal totals due to rounding.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Notes: ,1) Estimates of <3 indicate insufficient data available to compute estimates;,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,"2) Beginning in 2012, changes in cooking, electrical malfunction, appliances, and equipment malfunction estimates may be the result of a National Fire Incident Reporting System (NFIRS) edit change (""NFIRS Version 5.0 Design Documentation,"" January 2012, Relational Edit #181, Fire Module, Equipment Involved in Ignition, Page 108, https://www.nfirs.fema.gov/documentation/design/2012/NFIRS_5.0_Design_Documentation_1-2012.pdf). Starting with the 2015 NFIRS data collection, this edit change was reverted back to the way the data were collected prior to 2012.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
